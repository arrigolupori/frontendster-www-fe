		question: 'What is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?',
		answer:
			'An MVP is the bare minimum required to make a web product viable for business purposes (i.e. basic functionality, payments integrated, full authentication, etc). This does NOT mean that parts of the web app cannot be delivered without first reaching MVP status. I encourage an iterative, bi-weekly delivery approach to get some of the functionality available early on for beta testing.',

			"I've run a marketing agency for 3 years and never left any project unattended or undelivered. The same goes with the 2 years that I've spent working as a freelancer. I have utmost respect for your investment and will communicate progress with you 2-3 times a week.",
